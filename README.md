# lazyreader

This program is written just to because I was too lazy to read few articles so I researched if it possible to do so or not and at last, I was able to write this simple program using the help of few websites.This a simple program that converts text to speech. 

There are several APIs available to convert text to speech in Python. One of such APIs is the Google Text to Speech API commonly known as the gTTS API
The gTTS API supports several languages including English, Hindi, Tamil, French, German and many more. The speech can be delivered in any one of the two available audio speeds, fast or slow
